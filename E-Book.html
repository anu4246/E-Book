                        <p>________________</p>   
                        <p>Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were
                            Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.</p>
                        <p>They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the
                                doorstep and played in the dust.</p>
                        <p>But one day their mother—Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit—expected friends to tea;
                            so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the
                            fine company arrived.</p>

                        <p>Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers;
                            and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a
                            chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.</p>

                         <p>Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His
                            mother sewed them on again.</p>
                        <p>When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out
                                into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.</p>
                        <p>"Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs.
                                    Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the
                                    pig-stye and the Puddle-Ducks."</p>
                        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/cLx865RR/tom23.jpg" alt="Now keep your frocks clean, children!" title="Now keep your frocks clean, children!"><br>
                        <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4NJ31HYZ/tom24.jpg" alt="Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily." title="Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.">
                    <p>Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they
                        trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.</p>
                    <p>When they stood up there were several green smears!</p>
                    <p>"Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall," said Moppet.</p>
                    <p>They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a
                        jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.</p>
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/L58rJSsd/tom27.jpg" alt="They turned their pinafores back to front." title="They turned their pinafores back to front.">

                <p>Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in
                    trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and
                    shedding buttons right and left.</p>
                 <p>He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.</p>
                 <p>Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the
                    rest of his buttons burst.</p>

                <p>While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the
                    three Puddle-Ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the
                    other and doing the goose step—pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!</p>
                <p>They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had
                        very small eyes and looked surprised.</p>
                <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/SRGCv0LK/tom35.jpg" alt="The Puddle-Ducks" title="The Puddle-Ducks">
                <br><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1zN6ZV02/tom36.jpg" alt="Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on." title="Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.">
                <p>Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-Duck, picked up the
                    hat and tucker and put them on.</p>
                <p>Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended
                        after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the
                        way down.</p>
                <p>"Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck," said Moppet—"Come and help us to dress
                            him! Come and button up Tom!"</p>

                <p>Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up

                <p>But he put them on <i>himself!</i> They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.</p>
                <p>"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck.</p>

                <p>And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-Duck set off up the road, keeping
                    step—pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!</p>
                <p>Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the
                        wall with no clothes on.</p>

                <p>She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the

                <p>"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am
                        affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.</p>
                <p>She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that
                            they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.</p>

                <p>Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: <i>not</i> in the least.</p>
                <p>Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed
                    the dignity and repose of the tea party.</p>
                <p>And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to
                tell you more about Tom Kitten!</p>
